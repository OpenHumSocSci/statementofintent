# Statement of Intent

_We believe in the importance of translation, cultural and linguistic. Please fork, adapt, and share back!_

## Who we are

We are a multidisciplinary and international group of librarians, scholars, researchers, scholarly communicators, open publishing advocates, open education practitioners and students working in the Humanities and Social Sciences. We are invested in the values and advantages of the open movement, and believe it offers solutions to the challenges facing not only our disciplines, but the world. 

We first convened at Harnack House, Berlin during OpenCon 2017, a conference for the next generation of leaders in Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data.

## Our aims

The primary aim of this group is to advocate for the inclusion and advancement of Open in the Humanities and Social Sciences, both within and outside of the Open movement. We are working to recruit and inspire new open advocates and practitioners. We want to decolonize the Humanities and Social Sciences to promote linguistic, cultural, and disciplinary diversity within the field and the Open movement. We want the Humanities and Social Sciences to be recognized as valuable and significant contributors to the Open Movement. 

Given the vital importance of research visibility, public engagement, and longevity of scholarship, the Humanities and Social Sciencesâ€™ significant contributions to our collective understanding of peoples and cultures merit a highlighted role in OpenCon and the Open Movement at large.

* We believe open provides an opportunity for researchers and educators to engage with the same stakeholders to co-create research and educational materials.
* We believe in the power of sharing stories, ideas, inspiration and challenges within our community, and working together to achieve our goals.
